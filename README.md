# Create web apps using R Shiny 

The slides and supplementary files from UseR's 10/1/2015 meeting are available in this repository. To walk through the presentation at your own pace, either clone the repository to your computer or dowload all of the folders in the repository to one directory. You can then use R to kint `user-slides.Rmd` to an html document. Note that you need to have the packages `kintr`, `shiny`, `maps`, and `mapproj` installed and loaded for the slides to compile.
